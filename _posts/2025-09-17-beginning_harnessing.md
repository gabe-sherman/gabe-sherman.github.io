As a newcomer to the computer security world working on my first paper, *[No Harness, No Problem: Oracle-guided Harnessing for Auto-generating C API Fuzzing Harnesses](https://futures.cs.utah.edu/papers/25ICSE-b.pdf)*, I inevitably spent countless hours studying, building, and running fuzzing harnesses. This guide aims to answer the questions and issues I struggled with early on, along with common mistakes and topics I‚Äôve since helped others work through.

Getting started in this space can feel daunting, but I hope this blog post can serve as a resource for those who are interested in beginning their fuzzing journey. Below, I outline the harness development process from beginning to end, with a special focus on harnessing and fuzzing **software libraries**. Keep in mind that this is an iterative process and it's rarely a one-shot attempt, so don‚Äôt be afraid to get stuck or make mistakes!

# Prerequisites

## Linux Ecosystem and the Command Line

The guidance offered in this post is primarily centered around working in the Linux ecosystem. Familiarity with shell commands is encouraged, and knowledge of basic tasks like setting environment variables, installing packages, and leveraging build systems will be helpful.

## Familiarity With Compilers

One of the biggest headaches when it comes to developing a fuzzing harness is actually building both the target and the harness itself. Debugging during this stage is likely, so a basic understanding of compilers and their usage is encouraged. Nevertheless, in [the build process section](about:blank#the-build-process) I cover the absolute necessities.

## AFL++

[AFLplusplus](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus) is today‚Äôs state-of-the-art fuzzing engine for most security practitioners. This tool allows you to simply plug in a fuzzing harness and let AFL++ worry about the other complex aspects of fuzzing like seed scheduling, input mutation, and more. To learn more about what AFL++ does, I‚Äôd encourage checking out its [landing page](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus) on GitHub.

# Choosing your target

When it comes to actually finding a target to fuzz, there's unfortunately no universal approach, but there are important properties to look for that indicate a strong target.

## Clear ‚ÄúInjection‚Äù Points

Since the [dawn of fuzzing](https://www.paradyn.org/papers/fuzz.pdf) in 1988, software that interacts with *user-controlled* inputs has been a primary target for bug discovery. For example, the [objdump](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/objdump.1.html) command line utility is a strong fuzz target because its functionality revolves around parsing user-provided binary files. Fuzzing objudmp allows us to throw millions of such files at it and discover buggy behavior [like this](https://blog.coffinsec.com/bug-hunting/2018/01/19/Fuzzing-binutils-Pt1-OOB-Read.html)!

This same principle applies to harnessing. Especially for those new to fuzzing, I would recommend targeting a system that has a clear ‚Äúinjection‚Äù site. For example, let‚Äôs take a look at the below function provided by [libucl](https://github.com/vstakhov/libucl/tree/8a0294f9eaa4e70342e562cb92792bbe3df90e70).

```
/**
 * Load ucl object from a string
 * @param parser parser structure
 * @param data the pointer to the string
 * @param len the length of the string, if `len` is 0 then `data` must be zero-terminated string
 * @return true if string has been added and false in case of error
 */
UCL_EXTERN bool ucl_parser_add_string (struct ucl_parser *parser,
        const char *data, size_t len);
```

By looking at its signature, we can see the `ucl_parser_add_string` function consumes user input through a string buffer and adds it to the provided `ucl_parser` struct. This is a great target as it clearly demonstrates an injection site for user-provided data.

Finding injection sites for a new target is not always straightforward‚Äîit‚Äôs a bit of an art in and of itself‚Äîbut this is an important step when it comes to narrowing in on a target. These sites serve as the main method for feeding fuzzer-generated inputs into the target in a meaningful way.

## Room For Novelty

When considering a fuzz target, we ideally want to be on the frontier of bug discovery, exploring the ‚ÄúWild Westü§†‚Äù of under-tested code. For example, if a library has been ‚Äúfuzzed to death‚Äù (i.e., it has been actively fuzzed by strong harnesses for a significant amount of time), the odds of discovering a new bug by targeting the same code is low. This is an important consideration when the goal is to discover new bugs. Before deciding on a target, it‚Äôs helpful to ask **‚ÄúWhat aspect of this system is under-tested?"** and **"How can I target that and reveal new behavior?"** If the answers to these questions are clear, this is a great point to start from.

## High Impact (Bonus Points!)

**As a general note, always act responsibly.** If you discover a bug while fuzzing, please follow coordinated disclosure practices and report it through the appropriate channels.

Fuzzing high impact software can be especially powerful when it comes to bug discovery, as their effects have the potential to be wide-reaching and extremely consequential in some cases. High impact can mean different things depending on the context, but software that is widely used or is critical to a valuable product or service certainly fits the bill.

# The Build Process

Now that we‚Äôve chosen our target, we can get started with building our harnessing ecosystem. Unfortunately, the build process for harnessing is largely target-dependent with wide variability, but I aim to provide general advice common to most targets. As a helpful resource, I‚Äôve linked a `Makefile` I wrote to demonstrate this exact topic for our University of Utah CTF team [here](https://github.com/gabe-sherman/cybersec_fuzzing_demo/blob/main/demo/Makefile)!

## Building the Target

The goal of this step is to build our target with AFL++ instrumentation, allowing its compiler to inject coverage tracking functionality into the library. In my experience, most targets use either the `Autotools` or `CMake` build system, so below I provide details about a few important components of each that are helpful during the build process.

### Autotools

The `configure` script provided by a target allows users to provide common compiler flags such as `CC` and `CXX`. These flags allow us to tell the build system to use AFL++-provided compilers rather than traditional `clang` or `gcc`. In a lot of cases, it‚Äôs truly as simple as:

`./configure CC=afl-clang-fast CXX=afl-clang-fast && make all` 

Other helpful flags or arguments include `CFLAGS`, `CXXFLAGS`, and `--(enable/disable)-(static/shared)`

### CMake

Similar to `Autotools`, when instrumenting with `CMake`, our goal is to simply tell the build system we want to use an AFL++-provided compiler. To perform this with CMake, we can use the `-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER` and `-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER` flags. Again, other helpful flags include `-DCMAKE_C_FLAGS`, `-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS`, and `-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS`.

As a side note, if all else fails, `afl-qemu` uses dynamic instrumentation to enable fuzzing for systems that are not built with AFL++ instrumentation. Information about that can be found [here](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus/tree/7d77cbd89e29c290c6b110a556bed3c778788610/qemu_mode).

## Building the Harness

This step ensures that the harness is correctly linked and loaded against our instrumented target. This is where familiarity with compiling is helpful, but I‚Äôve detailed a few important aspects below.

### Including Header Files

The harness must include the header files of the target that provide declarations for the library-specific properties used by the harness. For example, when calling the `ucl_parser_add_string` function in our harness, we must make sure the harness also includes `ucl.h`, as this provides the function declaration.

### `-I` flags

During compilation, the `-I` flag must provide the path to the header file included in the harness. For example, if our harness is located at `lib/harness.c` and the header file is located at `lib/libucl/include/ucl.h`, our `-I` flag should point to `lib/libucl/include`.

### `-L & -l` flags

While header files provide the declaration of a given function, we also must include its actual *implementation*. The `-L` flag should provide the path(s) to the `.so` or `.a` library file(s) produced during the build of the target. Finally, the `-l` flag should describe the name of the library to be used. The combination of these two flags essentially tells the compiler *where* to find the library, as well as the exact library to link against.

Again, for more examples, I highly recommend checking out the `Makefile` in [this demo](https://github.com/gabe-sherman/cybersec_fuzzing_demo/blob/main/demo/Makefile) to get an idea of how this works in practice.


## Putting It All
The code below is a fuzzing harness that feeds AFL++-generated inputs to libucl through the function `ucl_parser_add_string`.
```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <errno.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <ucl.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    //Read input from file and store it in a buffer
    FILE *f;
    char *data = NULL;
    long size;

    if(argc < 2)
        exit(0);

    f = fopen(argv[1], "rb");
    if(f == NULL)
        exit(0);

    fseek(f, 0, SEEK_END);

    size = ftell(f);
    rewind(f);

    if(size < 1)
        exit(0);

    data = (char*)malloc((size_t)size+1);
    if(data == NULL)
        exit(0);

    if(fread(data, (size_t)size, 1, f) != 1)
        exit(0);

    // create a parser to use later
    struct ucl_parser *parser;
    parser = ucl_parser_new(0);

    // start passing fuzzer-generated input into the library
    ucl_parser_add_string(parser, data, size);

    // check if any errors occur. If they do, exit
    if (ucl_parser_get_error(parser) != NULL) {
        return 0;
    }

    // free up allocated memory
    ucl_parser_free (parser);
    return 0;
}
```

# Start Fuzzing!

Phew! We‚Äôre almost there. Now we can get to the fun stuff. For this section I‚Äôll describe the minimal commands needed to get a fuzzing trial up and running along with common mistakes and pitfalls I‚Äôve seen along the way that result in ineffective fuzzing trials.

To begin fuzzing, it‚Äôs typically as simple as:

`afl-fuzz -o <output_dir> -i <seed_dir> ./harness.out @@`

This command tells AFL++ to begin fuzzing the harness binary, using seed inputs from the directory specified by `-i` and writing output artifacts (like crashes and coverage data) to the directory given by `-o`. The `@@` token is replaced with the path to each fuzzer-generated input during execution. Further information about AFL++ command line options can be found [here](https://man.archlinux.org/man/extra/afl++/afl-fuzz.8.en)

## Symptoms of an Ineffective Fuzzing Trial

### ‚ÄúNew Edges on‚Äù Quickly Plateaus

This is advice is target dependent, but if the count of `new edges on` in the AFL++ UI quickly stops increasing after beginning a fuzzing trial, this should raise some alarms. In the past, I‚Äôve seen a lot of students immediately put the blame on their harness, assuming they are not exercising interesting functionality in the target. While this can be the case, it‚Äôs important to ask and answer these two questions:


<figure>
  <img src="/assets/img/incorrect.png" alt="An incorrectly instrumented library" />
  <figcaption>üö®üö® A minimal increase in new edges should raise alarms.</figcaption>
</figure>
<!-- 
![An incorrectly instrumented library](/assets/img/incorrect.png) -->


**‚ÄúAm I linking against the correct library?‚Äù**

If the harness is **statically** linked with `-l:` syntax, the answer to this is almost definitely **yes**. But, if the harness is dynamically linked, make this check. Especially when fuzzing widely used libraries, that library may already be installed in a common directory like `/usr/lib/`. Without setting the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable, the harness is likely linking against the *uninstrumented* version of the library in the environment. To check this, run `ldd <path_to_harness>`, which will provide the name and path of all libraries dynamically linked by the harness. Make sure the target library‚Äôs path is included in this output. If not, set the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable to point to the instrumented build of the library.

**‚ÄúIs my library actually instrumented?‚Äù**

Once we‚Äôve made sure we‚Äôre linking against the target library build, we can also make sure that the library itself is actually instrumented. Running a command like

`objdump -D <path_to_library> | grep afl`

should spit out some output highlighting the symbols provided by AFL++. If not, revisit the [build](about:blank#building-the-target) section.

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/img/afl-grep.png" alt="Checking afl symbols" />
  <figcaption>Checking to ensure a library is correctly instrumented. The afl symbols signal yes!</figcaption>
</figure>

### High Crash Rate

The harness either found a bug in the target that‚Äôs *really* quick and easy to trigger‚Ä¶or the harness itself is doing something incorrectly. Best to make sure it‚Äôs the former over the latterüòâ.

## Conclusion
As demonstrated by the thousands of vulnerabilities discovered with the help of Google's [OSS-Fuzz](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz?tab=readme-ov-file#trophies) project, fuzzing harnesses are among the most useful ways to discover high-impact bugs. This guide aims to cover the basics of building a fuzzing a target. By following these three steps, you'll be well on your way toward impactful fuzzing.
- Choose a meaningful target
- Build it using AFL++ instrumentation
- Begin fuzzing and monitor the trial for common signs of inaccuracy
