## Research Interest

My research focuses on fuzz testing, with a strong passion for proactively securing widely used software. I am particularly interested in extending fuzz testing to previously unexplored areas. My current work centers on automating harness generation for open-source libraries. Some of the bugs I have found can be found [here](https://futures.cs.utah.edu/bugs/?search=gabe+sherman).
