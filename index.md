## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="me.jpg">

Second-year Ph.D. student at the University of Utah performing research in computer security and fuzzing.

Outside of academia, I enjoy spending my time in the nearby Wasatch Mountains, reading, and eating good food!

## Research Interest

My research focuses on fuzz testing, with a strong passion for proactively securing widely used software. I am particularly interested in extending fuzz testing to previously unexplored areas. My current work centers on automating harness generation for open-source libraries. Some of the bugs I have found can be found here: https://futures.cs.utah.edu/bugs/?search=gabe+sherman
