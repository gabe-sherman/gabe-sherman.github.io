## Research Interest

My research is based around fuzz testing, and Iâ€™m passionate about proactively protecting widely used software. My work focuses on automatic harness generation for open source libraries. I also earned my undergrad from the University of Utah, where I discovered my interest in cybersecurity and began researching in the field.
