## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="me.jpg">

Hello! I'm a first-year PhD student in Computer Security at the University of Utah.


Outside of academia, I enjoy spending my time snowboarding or hiking in the nearby Wasatch Mountain range!

## Research Interest

My research is mainly based around fuzz testing, and Iâ€™m passionate about proactively protecting widely used software. My work focuses on automatic harness generation for open source libraries. I also earned my undergrad from the University of Utah, where I discovered my interest in cybersecurity and began researching in the field.
