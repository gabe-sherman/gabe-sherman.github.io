title: About Me
---

Hello! I’m Gabe, a student at the University of Utah currently pursuing a PhD in computer security. I found my way into this field somewhat later than most—during my junior year of college—but it quickly became a driving passion behind my research and work.

Outside of academia, I enjoy spending spending my time in the mountains surrounding Salt Lake City. On a given weekend you can find me either hiking or snowboarding.

This website serves as a space for me to share insights, reflections, and updates both related to my research and personal interests.
